<h2> Main Exploration Question:</h2>
<p><b>“Today, women’s professional sports are growing rapidly. Choose an athlete in any team or individual sport to research: When did a professional league for her sport first form? What are her contributions to her sport? How has she influenced society beyond athletics?”</b><br><br><b>Our person of research is... Serena Williams!</b></p>

<b><span>Answer by Sam:</span><h4>Sub Question 1:<h3>When did a professional league for her (Serena Williams') sport first form?</h3></h4></b>
 <p> The Fed cup was where women’s competitions were held and was created in the 1960s. The actual league dates back to the 1900s which shows the gap between men and women. The actual sport originated in Europe but it wasn’t as popular as lawn tennis. became more popular in the late 18th and the 19th century. Courts also transformed from grass to clay to hardwood flooring and now with cement courts.y.<br><br>
  
  The women’s public sphere was recently opened up but the sports sphere was still far away. Another fake reason preventing women from playing was about how women had “low energy” and too much exercise could be dangerous. Most other sports were rumoured to render women infertile or have negative effects on women. Because of these false rumours many women were discouraged from playing these sports and we might’ve lost our chance to see some of the best tennis players ever but we’ll never know. But now that the public sphere has opened and will hopefully stay, we can see other players like Serena rise up and join the professional league.

   <b><span>Answer by Daniel:</span><h4>Sub Question 2:<h3>What are her (Serena Williams') contributions to her sport?</h3></h4></b>
   
   <p>Serena Williams had many contributions to her sport (tennis).<br>Serena Williams influenced many people to start playing tennis and she also revolutionized women’s tennis with her powerful style of play and for winning more Grand Slam singles titles (23) than any other woman or man during the open era. She also was a trailblazer because she paved the way for younger nonwhite tennis players in pro tennis and this changed tennis forever and helped improve the diversity of tennis players throughtout the world. (Because tennis used to be like a sport only rich white people played, but now the diversity of people who play tennis is much higher)</p>

<h2> Main Exploration Question:</h2>
<p><b>“Today, women’s professional sports are growing rapidly. Choose an athlete in any team or individual sport to research: When did a professional league for her sport first form? What are her contributions to her sport? How has she influenced society beyond athletics?”</b><br><br><b>Our person of research is... Serena Williams!</b></p>

 <h4>Sub Question 1:<h3>When did a professional league for her sport first form?</h3></h4>
 <p> The Fed cup was where women’s competitions were held and was created in 1963. The actual league dates back to the 1900s which shows the gap between men and women. The actual sport originated in Europe in the 1200s but with vastly different rules and bare hands not a racket. The league continued to grow evolving from a hand to a glove to finally the current object of choice, the racket. This was real tennis though not the current sport which is lawn tennis. Lawn tennis was born through the decline of real tennis along with racquets and squash racquets. Lawn tennis became more popular in the late 18th and the 19th century.<br><br>
  
  The women’s public sphere was recently opened up but the sports sphere was still far away. Another fake reason preventing women from playing was about how women had “low energy” and too much exercise could be dangerous. Most other sports were rumoured to render women infertile or have negative effects on women. Because of these false rumours many women were discouraged from playing these sports and we might’ve lost our chance to see some of the best tennis players ever but we’ll never know. But now that the public sphere has opened and will hopefully stay, we can see other players like Serena rise up and join the professional league.

   <h4>Sub Question 2:<h3>What are her contributions to her sport?</h3></h4>
   
   <p>Serena Williams influenced many people to start playing tennis and she also revolutionized women’s tennis with her powerful style of play and for winning more Grand Slam singles titles (23) than any other woman or man during the open era. She also was a trailblazer because she paved the way for younger nonwhite tennis players in pro tennis and this changed tennis forever and made it more diverse. (Because tennis used to be like a sport white people played, now it is a sport that everybody can play)</p>

   <h4>Sub Question 3:<h3>How has she influenced society beyond athletics?</h3></h4>
   <p>Serena Williams has influenced society way beyond athletics. She beat all of the racial and gender barriers to become a champion in tennis. She inspired many people to stand up to the obstacles in their way (like racism, sexism, e.t.c.) and she is a strong leader that has helped many people through charities, fundraisers, and many other things. </h4>
